## 🔭 What I’m working on

* Improving and polishing my **WhatsApp Chat Analyzer** (Streamlit) and its deployment/workflow.
* Research & implementation of metaheuristic approaches for the **Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP)**.
* Extending my **P2P file-sharing game (game-theoretic simulation using Correlated Equilibrium)** from 2-player to N-player settings.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

* Full-stack web development (Python backend + modern front-end) and advanced **Data Structures & Algorithms** for placement prep.

## 💬 Ask me about

**C++**, **Python**, algorithms, genetic algorithms & metaheuristics, simulation modeling, and competitive programming.

## 🔧 Areas of expertise & skills

* **Programming languages:** C++ (primary), Python.
* **Algorithms & CP:** Competitive programming, strong focus on algorithms and problem solving (DSA up to advanced topics; ongoing revision).
* **Optimization & Metaheuristics:** Genetic Algorithm implementation for EVRP with charging/energy/load constraints and visualization.
* **Simulation & Game Theory:** P2P file sharing game using Correlated Equilibrium — LP-based CE solver, regret-matching learning, delay modeling (M/D/1 queues).
* **Web & Deployment:** Built Streamlit apps and deployed (Render, PythonAnywhere). Comfortable with Python-based web tools and notebooks (Google Colab).
* **Tooling & workflow:** Git, Linux command-line, CLI tools, data visualization (Python ecosystem).

## 🔍 Selected projects

> Short summaries — link the repositories under your account (replace the `[...]` with real repo links if you want).

* **WhatsApp Chat Analyzer** — A Streamlit web app for parsing and analyzing WhatsApp chat exports. Deployed on Render for interactive exploration and quick analytics. (`github.com/sachin7717/whatsapp-chat-analyzer`)

* **Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) — Genetic Algorithm** — A metaheuristic solver with route validation, energy/load-aware constraints, charging logic, and visualization. CLI-based output for reproducible experiments. (`github.com/sachin7717/evrp-ga`)

* **P2P File Sharing Game using Correlated Equilibrium** — N-player simulation framework (built in Python) that models delay via M/D/1 queues, evaluates utilities (negative delay), uses distributed regret-matching to learn CE, and has an LP-based CE solver and visualizations. Implemented and tested in Google Colab. (`github.com/sachin7717/p2p-ce-game`)

* **Pharmacy Shop Management System** — A project to manage billing and inventory (planned/implemented features include role-based access, monthly reports, and organized bill storage). (`github.com/sachin7717/pharmacy-shop-management`)
